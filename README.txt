Smart_viv README

This code is designed to be used with a wifi enabled Rasberry pi,
AM2302 temperaturesensor(s) and Energenie pi-Mote remote control 
extension lead.

These files have been written using code and guide produced by Tom's 
Carnivores:

I have modified some of the code to allow for multiple probes to be 
monitored at once, and have multiple energinie sockets to be controlled.
